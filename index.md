## Welcome 

My name is Zeng Yanbo. 
I am an IBI1 student at the Zhejiang University - University of Edinburgh (ZJE) Institute.
I love playing badminton and I play it really well.
I am particularly fond of Mapo Tofu, a Chinese traditional dish celebrated for its complex and harmonious blend of spicy, numbing, and savory flavors.
